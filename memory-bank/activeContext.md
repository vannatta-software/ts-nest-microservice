# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the TS Nest Microservice Template project.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank` directory.
- Created `projectbrief.md` with an overview of the project.
- Created `productContext.md` detailing the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Create `systemPatterns.md` to document the system architecture and design patterns.
- Create `techContext.md` to document technologies, development setup, and dependencies.
- Create `progress.md` to track project status, known issues, and evolution of decisions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The memory bank will serve as the primary source of truth for project context.
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and regularly updated.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adherence to CQRS and event-driven architecture.
- Use of NestJS modules for clear separation of concerns.
- Preference for TypeScript for strong typing and better maintainability.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The template is designed to be highly modular and extensible.
- The existing file structure already reflects many of the intended architectural patterns.
