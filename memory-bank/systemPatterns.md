# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The project follows a microservice architecture, with each service designed to be independently deployable and scalable. Communication between services is primarily event-driven, leveraging message brokers.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **NestJS Framework**: Chosen for its modularity, strong TypeScript support, and enterprise-grade features.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations, improving scalability, maintainability, and performance.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses domain events to communicate changes between aggregates and services, promoting loose coupling.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Focuses on modeling the business domain, with clear boundaries for aggregates, entities, and value objects.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic, making it easier to switch databases or ORMs.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Mediator Pattern**: Implemented via `MediatorService` to dispatch commands and queries to their respective handlers.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for different event bus implementations (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis), allowing easy switching.
- **Factory Pattern**: Potentially used for creating instances of domain objects or infrastructure components.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leveraged heavily by NestJS for managing dependencies and promoting testability.

## Component Relationships
- **API Layer**: Exposes HTTP/WebSocket endpoints, receives commands/queries, and publishes events.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic, aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain events.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides implementations for persistence (MongoDB), messaging (event buses), and other cross-cutting concerns (filters, Swagger).
- **Contracts Layer**: Defines shared DTOs, commands, queries, and events for inter-service communication.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Command Flow**: API Controller -> MediatorService -> Command Handler -> Domain Aggregate -> Repository -> Event Bus.
- **Query Flow**: API Controller -> MediatorService -> Query Handler -> Repository -> Data.
- **Event Flow**: Domain Aggregate -> Event Bus -> Event Handler (within the same or different service).
