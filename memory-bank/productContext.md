# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a robust and flexible microservice template to accelerate the development of new services within an organization. It addresses the need for a standardized, scalable, and maintainable foundation, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency across different microservices.

## Problems Solved
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: New microservices can be spun up quickly with pre-configured CQRS, eventing, and database patterns.
- **Architectural Consistency**: Enforces a consistent architectural style (CQRS, event-driven) across services, simplifying understanding and maintenance.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Provides a foundation that inherently supports horizontal scaling.
- **Integration Complexity**: Offers patterns for inter-service communication (e.g., through message brokers).
- **Developer Onboarding**: Lowers the barrier to entry for new developers by providing a well-structured and documented codebase.

## How it Should Work
The template should allow developers to:
- Define new commands and queries easily.
- Implement event handlers and publish domain events.
- Interact with a MongoDB database using a clear repository pattern.
- Expose API endpoints and integrate with Swagger for documentation.
- Utilize WebSockets for real-time communication where needed.
- Switch between different event bus implementations (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis) with minimal code changes.

## User Experience Goals (for developers using the template)
- **Ease of Use**: Developers should find it intuitive to extend and customize the template.
- **Clear Guidance**: The structure and existing examples should provide clear guidance on how to implement new features.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Enable quick development of new microservice functionalities.
- **Debugging Simplicity**: The structured approach should make it easier to debug and troubleshoot issues.
- **Performance**: The underlying architecture should support high performance and low latency.
