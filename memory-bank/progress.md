# Progress

## Current Status
The initial memory bank has been set up for the TS Nest Microservice Template. All core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial content.

## What Works
- The basic project structure for a NestJS microservice is in place.
- CQRS patterns (commands, queries, events, handlers) are defined.
- Multiple event bus implementations (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis) are provided as options.
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose is set up.
- API and WebSocket modules are present.
- Swagger documentation utility is included.

## What's Left to Build / Implement
- **Full Feature Implementation**: The existing "example" modules provide a template, but actual business logic for specific microservices needs to be implemented.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Security mechanisms are not yet integrated.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: While test files exist, a full suite of unit, integration, and E2E tests for specific features needs to be developed.
- **Error Handling and Observability**: Robust logging, monitoring, and tracing solutions need to be fully integrated and configured.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automation for building, testing, and deploying the microservice.
- **Production-Ready Configuration**: Fine-tuning environment variables, scaling parameters, and security settings for production deployment.
- **Message Broker Configuration**: Specific configuration and connection details for Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis in a production environment.

## Known Issues
- No specific known issues with the template structure itself at this stage.
- Potential issues may arise during specific feature implementations or integration with external systems.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use NestJS and TypeScript has proven effective for building scalable and maintainable microservices.
- The modular design facilitates easy extension and customization.
- The choice of multiple event bus options provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios.
