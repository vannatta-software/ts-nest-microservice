# Project Brief

## Project Name
TS Nest Microservice Template

## Overview
This project is a TypeScript-based NestJS microservice template, designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building microservices. It incorporates best practices for CQRS, event-driven architecture, and database interactions.

## Core Requirements
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing loads through microservice architecture.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns using CQRS and domain-driven design principles.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and integrate with other services.
- **Observability**: Built-in mechanisms for logging, monitoring, and tracing (to be implemented or integrated).
- **Reliability**: Resilient to failures with proper error handling and fault tolerance (to be implemented or integrated).

## Goals
- Provide a ready-to-use template for new microservice development.
- Demonstrate effective use of NestJS, TypeScript, CQRS, and event-driven patterns.
- Facilitate rapid development and deployment of microservices.

## Key Features
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) implementation.
- Event-driven architecture with various bus implementations (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis).
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose schemas and repositories.
- API layer with controllers and examples.
- WebSocket integration for real-time notifications.
- Swagger documentation setup.
- Centralized exception handling.

## Target Audience
Developers and teams looking for a solid foundation to build TypeScript-based microservices using NestJS.

## Future Considerations
- Integration with a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for production environments.
- Implementation of authentication and authorization.
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, E2E).
- CI/CD pipeline setup.
- Containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes).
