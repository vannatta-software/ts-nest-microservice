# Microservice Implementation Workflow

This workflow guides you through the process of building a new microservice based on the TS Nest Microservice Template. It follows a structured approach, leveraging Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event-Driven Design (EDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), and hexagonal architecture principles.

Each step in this workflow is designed to be completed sequentially. If you need to revisit an earlier step, please be aware that it may require re-evaluation and potential re-work of subsequent steps to maintain consistency.

## How to Use This Workflow

1.  **Follow the Steps Sequentially**: Start with "01 - Initial Setup" and proceed through the numbered files.
2.  **Interact with Cline**: Many steps will require you to provide information or make decisions. Cline will then generate or modify files (e.g., diagrams, code) based on your input.
3.  **Track Progress**: Refer to `workflows/progress.md` to see the current status of your service implementation. Cline will update this file as tasks are completed.
4.  **Review and Approve**: After Cline completes a task, you will be prompted to review and approve the changes before proceeding to the next step.
